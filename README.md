<h1>Planning and Execution</h1>
<p>I started with Wireframe, ERD and user stories for my app. Once I figured Out
what i wanted to do I started with coding. I worked with user authentication
first and moved to my resource recipes. Generated scaffold for my recipe resource
and tested with curl-scripts. Then designed the front-end and performed CRUD on
my recipe resource successfully.</p>
<h1>Problems faced</h1>
<p>After i met MVP I tried to add a custom route for my recipe resource.
I want users to view available recipe categories and see all recipes under the
category. I was able to add a custom route but couldn't get it display
categories due to some problem with serializer. Caleb helped me with a solution
which i'm gonna try fix it and make it work</p>
